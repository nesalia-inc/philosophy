# Verification Gates

Verification tools should be gates that block if requirements aren't met.

---

## The Gate Metaphor

```
Think of verification tools as GATES:

CODE -->| GATE |-->| GATE |-->| GATE |--> MERGE
        | Qual |    | Sec  |    | Perf |
               |              |
               v              v
          +---------------------------------+
          | IF GATE FAILS:                  |
          | - BLOCK the PR                 |
          | - SHOW what's wrong            |
          | - SUGGEST fixes               |
          | - PREVENT shipping bad code    |
          +---------------------------------+
```

## Claude Code Security Example

Claude Code Security is an AI-powered security gate:

- Scans code for security vulnerabilities
- Uses AI (not just pattern matching)
- Understands how components interact
- Multi-stage verification (Claude re-examines findings)
- Suggests PATCHES, not just problems
- Nothing applied without human approval

## React-Doctor Example

AST-based gate for React:

- Analyzes AST of React code
- Detects performance issues
- Detects correctness issues
- Runs as pre-commit or in CI

## Complete Gate System

```
CODE ---+--> SYNTAX GATE (ESLint)
        +--> TYPES GATE (TypeScript)
        +--> TESTS GATE (Vitest)
        +--> SECURITY GATE (Claude Code Security)
        +--> QUALITY GATE (AST-based rules)
        +--> PERFORMANCE GATE (Complexity analyzer)
        +--> VERIFICATION AGENT (AI-powered review)
        +--> HUMAN REVIEW (final approval)

ANY GATE FAILURE = BLOCK
```

## Defense in Depth

| Layer | Type | What it Catches |
|-------|------|-----------------|
| 1 | Syntax | Trivial issues |
| 2 | Types | Type safety |
| 3 | Tests | Functionality |
| 4 | Security | AI-powered vulnerabilities |
| 5 | Quality | Patterns |
| 6 | Performance | Complexity |
| 7 | Agent | Comprehensive review |
| 8 | Human | Final check |

## Implementation

```
Option 1: pre-commit hooks
  .git/hooks/pre-commit:
    fresh-gate --staged

Option 2: CI/CD pipeline
  GitHub Actions:
    - run: fresh-gate --all
    - if: gates.fail
      then: block merge

Option 3: IDE integration
  VS Code extension:
    - Inline warnings
    - Quick fixes
    - Real-time feedback

Option 4: Dedicated verification agents
  In CI:
    - fresh-agent security
    - fresh-agent quality
    - fresh-agent performance
```
